Hello, I'm Yili Shen, and I'm a third-year undergrad at School of Software Engineering 💻, Tongji University, advised by A. Prof. Hongfei Fan.


I've also learned a lot about chemistry 🧑‍🔬 theories in middle school and took chemical engineering as my major in my freshman year in Tongji University. Meanwhile, I joined [Lin Group](https://elements.chem.umass.edu/zlinqcgroup/) to do quantum chemistry research via machine learning view since 2021 summer.

I have a broad interest in computer science with particular interest in graph representation learning, which is a powerful tool to unearth everything beneath the chemical structures, and also an interesting way to solve NLP / network problems.

### May 17, 2022 update:

I'm going to give a talk on *International Symposium on Molecular Spectroscopy* at *Mini-symposium: Machine Learning*, to introduce my work on combining many-body expansion with garph neural networks on Jun 20, 2022 held in UIUC.
 

### Mar 24th, 2022 Update:

My work *Accelerating many\-body expansion theory through GCN\-based deep learning approaches* was selected as an ACS Spring - Poster Session work!
