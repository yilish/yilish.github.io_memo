Hello, I'm Yili Shen, and I'm a third-year undergrad at School of Software Engineering üíª, Tongji University.


I've also learned a lot about chemistry theories in high school, where I got first prize (top 1% nationwide) in Chinese Chemistry Olympiad (CChO). Thus, I took chemistry as my major in my freshman year in Tongji University. 

I have a broad interest in computer science with particular interest in graph representation learning whose downstream tasks can be variant from bioinformatics to chemistry modeling. Currently, I'm a research assistant in UMass Amherst focusing on using graph neural network to model quantum chemistry systems, meanwhile, I joined Baidu. Inc as a research intern to do researches on using GNNs to augment the embedding of genes with omics and drug datasets.

### Jul 16, 2022 update:
My work Improving Subgraph Representation Learning via Multi-View Augmentation was selected in ICML AI4Science poster session!

### May 17, 2022 update:

I'm going to give a talk on *International Symposium on Molecular Spectroscopy* at *Mini-symposium: Machine Learning*, to introduce my work on combining many-body expansion with garph neural networks on Jun 20, 2022 held in UIUC.
 

### Mar 24th, 2022 Update:

My work *Accelerating many\-body expansion theory through GCN\-based deep learning approaches* was selected as an ACS Spring - Poster Session work!
