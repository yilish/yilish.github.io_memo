# Yili's Homepage

Hello, I'm Yili Shen, and I'm a third-year undergrad at School of Software Engineering 💻, Tongji University, supervised by A. Prof. Hongfei Fan.


I've also learned a lot about chemistry 🧑‍🔬 theories in middle school and took chemical engineering as my major in my freshman year in Tongji University. Meanwhile, I joined [Lin Group](https://elements.chem.umass.edu/zlinqcgroup/) to do quantum chemistry research via machine learning view since 2021 summer.

I have a broad interest in computer science with particular interest in graph representation learning, which is a powerful tool to unearth everything beneath the chemical structures, and also an interesting way to solve NLP / network problems.
